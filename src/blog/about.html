      <h1>About the Author</h1>
      <p>Hey! If you're reading this, first: thanks for stopping by! Second,
      Welcome to my little online wall of scrawlings. I'm a hobbyist programmer,
      MTF transwoman, and an avid supporter of Web 1.0 revival initiatives. The
      web was created as a way of connecting people, and giving them a space
      they could make fully their own, with none of the limitations and sour spots
      of real life, like money, scarcity, and corporate interference. While that
      vision no longer holds true for most of the net, those quaint little corners
      still exist, and I'd like to do whatever I can to help preserve them and
      show more people that the internet can be more than the ad riddled,
      algorithmically optimized social media platforms we know today.
      </p>

      <h2>So, why a blog?</h2>
      <p>
      I have a lot of long, complex thoughts on a number of topics, and a blog
      is the perfect place to share them! Even if nobody really reads this, it's
      nice to have things in writing, both to make it easier to collect my thoughts,
      and to make it easy to share things with friends and other netizens. I
      hope you enjoy your time here, and maybe come back for more later!
      </p>
