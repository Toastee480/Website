      <h1>Welcome to Jamie's Journal!</h1>

      <p>Hello! I'm (the titular) Jamie, and this is my blog! This blog has no
      specific theme, much like rest of my site, and serves as a way to write
      down thoughts I have about any topic I deem important enough or have
      complex enough opinions about to warrant writing a blog post about. Expect
      long, somewhat rambly posts about anything im passionate about at the time.
      I hope you enjoy your stay here, however brief it may be, and that you come
      back for more later!
      </p>
