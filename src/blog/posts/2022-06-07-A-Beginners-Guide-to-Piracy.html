        <h1>An Intro to Piracy</h1><a href="#links"><h6 class="nopad">(or, just gimme the goods)</h6></a>
      </div>
      <p>OK... <i>THAT'S</i> enough of that... To clarify, this is a guide on
      piracy, yes, but not <i>that</i> kind of piracy. Today, you'll be learning how to
      <b>pirate online content</b>, as it's a very useful skill that a lot of people
      don't know much about beyond the basics, like TV and movie streaming. But,
      you may (probably not really) be saying, isn't that <shudder>ILLEGAL???</shudder>
      Well, yes! Piracy is by all means illegal, but the law does not always
      dictate morality. Piracy is an excellent tool, and in many cases the <i>only</i>
      tool, to fight <b>anti-competitive</b> or <b>anti-consumer</b> practices
      by the companies who control so much of our entertainment today.
      </p>
      <h2>The Problem With Copyright</h2>
      <p><b>Copyright</b> is flawed. <i>Very flawed</i>. It's been
      <i>mangled</i> by <b>excessive lobbying</b> from companies like
      <b>Disney</b> in order to <b>extend the copyright term</b> far beyond
      it's original scope, and can be abused easily. The full range of the
      issues plaguing copyright is far beyond the scope of this post, so
      we'll save that for another time, but the important part for this topic
      is <b>exclusive licensing</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
      Due to the <b>exclusive licensing rights</b> that govern the distribution of
      much of the content we consume, most notably <b>streaming media</b>,
      many of the companies in charge of the distribution of
      this content are <i>not directly competing</i> with the others. By
      making exclusivity deals, companies become the only one authorized to use
      a piece of copyrighted content. In doing so, they remove the potential
      for any competing service to <i>actually</i> replace it.
      </p>
      <p>In a pure competition, companies should be able to <b>replace one another</b>.
      One coffee shop carries almond milk, the rest do the same. This forces
      <b>innovation</b> and <b>pricing</b> to be the primary driving force of
      competition, causing new features, diverging design philosophies, and
      competitive prices. With exclusively licensed media, <b>none of this ever
      happens</b>. The core feature of most streaming services are
      their exclusive content and as no other service can replicate that content,
      they are <b>not in competition</b>. Instead, as content is pulled from
      competitors and made exclusive, consumers are just forced to <b>pay more</b> for
      the content they <b>already had</b> with a <b>worse user experience</b>.
      This is how streaming operates. The <i>only</i> way out of this hell is
      to <b>pirate</b> the content on these services. Piracy in order to
      circumvent unjust practices is known as <b>Ethical Piracy</b> and is
      morally just.
      </p>
      <h2>But What About the Creators?</h2>
      <p>It's easy to consider the creators of the content you're pirating to be
      collateral damage, but in reality most of the cast and crew of any show or
      movie are <b>paid up front</b>, either by <b>lump sum</b> or <b>salary</b>.
      The few who do get residuals are paid based on <b>reruns</b> and
      <b>licensing</b> to networks and streaming services. Of those that are
      even elligible, <b>very few</b> make significant money.
      (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residual_(entertainment_industry)#Examples">
      Enough so that a bar gave free drinks to anyone with a check for less than
      $1.00</a>) Those who do make a significant income from residuals are
      <b>successful, popular actors</b> who already have more than enough money to
      not be hurt by any sort of loss. As for the studio, they're paid up front
      when their show is licensed. In the end, <i>the only one hurt in any
      significant way is the streaming service</i> As far as games and anime go,
      they follow a similar story. <b>Game devs</b> are paid by <b>salary</b>, with piracy only
      affecting the studio execs and distribution platform, and studios are
      paid when a game is licensed exclusively. <b>Anime</b> is primarily funded through
      <b>merchandise and physical release sales</b>, and again <b>animators</b> are paid on
      <b>salary</b>. Streaming subscriptions are primarily used to fund the service
      itself, not the studios making the anime.
      </p>
      <h1 id="howto">So, How Do I Do It?</h1>
      <p>Piracy can seem a little intimidating at first, if you don't know where
      to look, but its really not very hard at all! The most important things to
      know about are <b>torrenting</b> and <b>VPNs</b>. Torrenting is a <b>peer to
      peer</b> file transfer protocol, meaning files are sent <b>directly
      between users</b>, and not through any kind of server.
      </p>
      <h2>Torrenting</h2>
      <p>While other forms of piracy exist, torrenting is in my opinion the best
      way to pirate content. Torrenting requires a <b>VPN</b>, a <b>Torrent
      Client</b>, and a <b>Torrent Tracker</b>. A VPN encrypts your internet
      traffic, so your ISP can't see what you're doing. Using one is <i>essential</i>
      when torrenting, as ISPs will throttle your connection or send you a
      DMCA notice for downloading copyrighted content otherwise. The second
      component, your <b>Torrent Client</b>, is what allows you to send and
      recieve files with other users. Finally, your <b>Torrent Tracker</b>
      lists torrent files and keeps track of the <b>seed</b> count. Each <b>seed</b>
      represents one user who is currently uploading pieces of the desired file
      to other users. The <b>higher the seed count</b>, the <b>faster the download</b>. It's
      courteous to <i>seed your torrents</i> after downloading, to at least a
      1.0 upload/download ratio, in order to keep the download functional for
      others, as a torrent with no seeds cannot be downloaded.
      </p>
      <h2>Streaming</h2>
      <p>While torrenting is safe, stable, and provides high quality files, some
      people don't have a VPN or just prefer the convenience of <b>streaming</b>.
      <b>Streaming</b> pirated content is much the same as legal streaming, but
      free and with no exclusivity walls. <b>Video quality is generally worse</b>,
      as videos are compressed for streaming, and sites are often <b>filled with
      fishy ads</b> in order to cover hosting costs, so be sure to install an <b>ad
      blocker</b> if you choose to stream your content. Despite the annoyances,
      streaming is a very convenient option, as no download is required and it
      does not require a VPN for use, so it's still a popular choice.
